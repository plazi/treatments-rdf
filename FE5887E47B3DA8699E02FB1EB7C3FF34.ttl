This aging technique is the only tested that the values shown here are hypothetical and intended only to means to age animals in cases where growth lines were not illustrate the methodology.

        dc:description           "Box 1. Assessing dinosaur longevity from growth-line counts Making growth curves for dinosaurs requires estimations of longevity for various individuals throughout development. To do thisι osteo- histologists sample bones from specimens spanning juvenile through adult developmental stages. The bones that are utilized show minimal remodeling (i.e. replacement or loss of the original bone during life because of metabolicι reproductiveι biomechanicalι or skeletal repair considerations [9]) and therefore provide a nearly complete record of development.Traditionallyι dinosaur researchers have used the femurι but other bones have been shown to be equally or more efficacious in some taxa. For exampleι multi-element sampling in tyrannosaurs has shown (Figure Ia) that the bones shown in blue [pubisι fibulaι ribsι gastralia (i.e. belly ribs) and some post-orbital skull bones] work better than the femur in these animals [12ι24]. The bones are sectioned transversely at mid-shaft using a slow-speed saw fitted with a diamond-tipped blade (Figure Ib). The sections (Figure Ic) are then affixed to glass petrographic slides and sanded/polished for viewing with polarized and/or reflected microscopy. On very large specimens for which making entire cross- sectional slidesisdifficultιresearchers polish the cut facesof the bones to reveal ‘polished lines’ that reflect hardness differences between indivi- dual growth lines [20ι23ι31]. Alternativelyι Sanders has developed a method whereby a diamond-tipped drill coring-bit is used to extract a cylinder of bone from which polished-line preparations or petrographic slides can be made [23]. Aging is conducted by making total growth line counts within elements [28]. Here (Figure Ic)ι a thin-sectionedι dorsal rib from TYrannosaurus rex (Field Museum of Natural Historyι Chicagoι FMNH PR 2081) shows growth lines (arrows) that were counted to age this specimen. Each line represents a period of slowed and/or potential stoppage in tissue deposition [9]. The highly vascularized regions fundamental system that indicates when growth slowed precipitously between the rings are known as zones and represent periods of active [22ι27]. At this point in developmentι somatic maturity and full-adult growth [8ι9]. The inset box denotes a region late in development size was reached.
