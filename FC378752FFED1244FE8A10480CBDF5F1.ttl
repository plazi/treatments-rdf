Considerable variability in this relationship is partly attributable to differences in predatory behavior. Pack hunting, for example, allows a predator to take relatively large prey. The relationship between Triceratops horridus and Tyrannosaurus rex falls well within the range extrapolated from data for extant (mammalian) carnivores and their prey. This indicates that T. rex could have been a competent predator of adult Triceratops horridus, even if acted as a solitary predator. Social groups of other large theropods may have been capable of dispatching significantly larger prey species, possibly even including adult sauropods." ;

Typical theropods have dentary teeth that are aligned just medial to the maxillary teeth, (a) This results in forces that are almost directly opposed when the teeth, exemplified here by those of Allosaurus fragilis, engage a food item, (b) In contrast, the dentary and maxillary teeth of Tyrannosaurus rex do not generate directly opposed forces in biting. Rather, the medially aligned dentaries tend to concentrate force near midline. In bilateral biting, the resulting stress on the prey is well-suited to crushing either bone or soft tissues." ;

        dc:description           "FIGURE 4 Relationship between bite force and body mass in predatory amniotes. This relationship was analyzed in order to infer the likely maximum bite force of the theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex. Bite force data obtained from extant predatory crocodylians, chelonians, squamates, and mammals are plotted against their body masses (see Table I) and subjected to correlation and least squares regression analyses. The bite forces of these predators are strongly correlated with their body masses across clades (r = 0.939; r2 = 0.882) and bite force increases with significant positive allometry relative to body mass (see text). Extrapolation of the regression to the estimated body mass of T. rex makes it possible to estimate its bite force at 235,000 N. Allometric increase in bite force is required only if selection continues to favor feeding on absolutely larger prey. If T. rex was not a direct, active predator of adult ornithischian dinosaurs of comparable size, its bite force should be lower than that predicted at its large body size, based upon data from extant predators." ;

        dc:description           "FIGURE 1 Effect of prey size on penetrating bites. Non-vital tissues of prey animals, such as integument and muscle, serve as barriers to predators seeking to inflict lethal damage on their prey. Assuming some minimum depth of penetration is required for a lethal bite, the depth of tissue through which a predator's teeth must penetrate increases linearly with increasing prey size. However, frictional resistance between flesh and teeth increases more rapidly than this. For a simple cone, frictional resistance increases with the square of the linear increase in depth of penetration. This results, for example, in four times the amount of frictional resistance to penetration that is twice as deep. A subconical tooth of Tyrannosaurus rex was modeled by computer and its engaged surface area was calculated for bites to 2 and 4 cm depth. In the latter case, the surface area of the tooth engaged is approximately three times that for a 2cmbite, due to the moderate lateral compression of T. rex teeth." ;

        dc:description           "FIGURE 3 Cranial morphology and jaw adductor musculature. Differences in the posterior width of the skull, relative to the tooth rows, may be constrained, together with tooth shape, by biting strategies such as crushing or penetration. The rather broadly-set tooth rows of Allosaurus fragilis (illustration modified after Madsen, 1976) appear to provide most theropods with a sufficiently concentrated bite force to facilitate lethal, penetrating bites. The expanded posterior part of the skull of Tyrannosaurus rex allowed for jaw adductor muscles with more cross-sectional area (illustration modified after Osborn, 1912). This suggests an atypically high bite force in this taxon, compared to most other theropods. The combination of a high bite force with comparatively broad, conical teeth implies adaptation for crushing the relatively greater mass of flesh and/or bones of large prey. This suggests that T. rex may have fed in significantly different ways from the majority of large theropods." ;
