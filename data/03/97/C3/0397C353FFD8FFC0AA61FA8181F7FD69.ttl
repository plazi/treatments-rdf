    dc:description "Fig. 2. Evidence for Q3G7R (2) hydrolyzing activity from cell-free Arabidopsis extracts is coincident with the loss of flavonol 3-O-β-glucoside-7-O-α-rhamnosides during synergistic abiotic stress recovery. (A) Plants were maintained under 0 mM nitrate at 10 °C (nitrogen deficiency and low temperature, NDLT; represented as the grey-shaded portion of the time course) for 7 days. Thereafter plants were repleted with 10 mM nitrate and maintained at 21 °C (nitrogen sufficiency and high temperature, NSHT; represented as the non-shaded portion of the time course) for 5 days. (B) As a control, plants of similar age were left under continual NSHT. K3G7R (1) and Q3G7R (2) concentrations were determined by UHPLC-DAD-MS n analysis of acidified methanolic extracts. A peak areas for Q3G7R (2; retention time = 16.3 min) and K3G7R 360 (retention time = 16.9 min) were compared to known amounts of Q3G and corrected for amount of fresh matter used for the extraction.MS n analysis confirmed the identity of K3G7R (1) with an [M—H] —1 parent ion of 593.2 and fragment ions of 447.2, 431.2 and 285.1; Q3G7R (2) analysis revealed a parent ion of 609.2 and fragment ions of 463.2, 447.2 and 301.1. Q3G7R (2) hydrolysis rate reflects the amount of product formed following 5 h incubation with Arabidopsis enzyme preparations using assay A and their analysis by HPLC-DAD (see Experimental). Reaction rates are expressed as pmol quercetin equivalents min—1 mg protein—1. For all plots, each data point represents the mean ± SE of three separate experiments." ;

The unrooted tree was constructed with maximum likelihood method in MEGA 6.06 (Tamura et al., 2013), following multiple protein sequence alignment with ClustalW (www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw; Larkin et al., 2007). The numbers shown at each node of the tree are representative of percent support values greater than 60 obtained by bootstrap analysis using 1000 replicates. BGLUs shown in black represent biochemically and/or functionally characterized enzymes; BGLUs shown in grey represent enzymes not yet biochemically characterized. Biochemically characterized flavonoid glycoside utilizing enzymes and are represented in blue.

Plants were maintained under 0 mM nitrate at 10 °C (nitrogen deficiency and low temperature, NDLT; represented as the grey-shaded portion of the time course) for 7 days. Thereafter, plants were repleted with 10 mM nitrate and transferred to 21 °C (nitrogen sufficiency and high temperature, NSHT; represented as the non-shaded portion of the time course) for 5 days.
