    dc:description "Fig. 1. Specimen of partial remains of a giant Arthropleura (anterior 12– 14 tergites) after excavation from the Serpukhovian Stainmore Formation, Howick Bay, Northumberland, England (CAMSM X.50355). Slab A and slab B are not true part and counterpart, but rather a split through the middle of a three- dimensional dorsal exoskeleton (see Fig. 7 and discussion in text)." ;

    dc:description "Fig. 2. Interpreted sketch of the fossil, as preserved in slab A, while still intact in fallen block of host sandstone prior to excavation. The overlap pattern of the paratergites on the left indicates that this is the ventral site of the dorsal exoskeleton. The typical ornamentation of the dorsal site of Arthropleura tergites and paratergites is therefore not visible." ;

(b) Slab B of the fossil (facing stratigraphically downwards). (c) Fallen block in which the fossil was discovered in January 2018 (white circle), showing split in rock where fossil was exposed (white triangle). Black circle denotes position in cliff profile from where the block fell. Listric faults in hanging wall of Howick Fault are highlighted, showing hanging wall thickening of mudrock (HT), attesting to synsedimentary origin (red arrows indicate sense of fault movement). Scale bar 2 m. (d) View of the fallen block (white circle) and original position (black circle) in the context of the Howick Fault damage zone and master fault separating the Alston and Stainmore formations; HT is at same position as in part (c). Host bed is immediately adjacent to one of two synsedimentary (Mississippian) normal faults that were later reactivated as strike-slip faults during the latest Carboniferous to Permian emplacement of the Whin Sill dolerite intrusion (De Paola et al. 2005). This structural context attests to strain in the fossil-bearing sandstone bed prior to full lithification and may explain certain features of the fossil (see main text). Blue dashed line show approximate stratigraphic position of the Lickar Limestone, marking the onset of the late Serpukhovian (Cózar and Somerville 2021). Scale bar 5 m.
