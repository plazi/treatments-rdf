    dc:description "Fig. 2. Minimum spanning network for haematozoa mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b haplotypes detected in South American waterfowl. Shaded circles represent unsampled nodes. All circles are drawn proportional to the frequency at which haplotypes were observed. Lines separating nodes are drawn to scale based on the number of nucleotide mutations, unless otherwise indicated by hash marks. Only haplotypes with a length of 358 bp or greater were included. Haplotype name abbreviations are as follows: Haem = Haemoproteus, Leuc = Leucocytozoon, and Plas = Plasmodium." ;

    dc:description "Fig. 3. Bayesian phylogenetic tree of haematozoa mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b haplotypes obtained from infected waterfowl. Trees were rooted with mammalian Plasmodium outgroups. Node tips are labeled with parasite genus (Haem = Haemoproteus, Leuc = Leucocytozoon, and Plas = Plasmodium), followed by the lineage name, GenBank accession number for each sequence, host order (passerine/waterfowl), and the country/state from which the samples were collected. All haplotypes identified in this study are highlighted in red. Numbers on branches represent posterior probabilities from the analysis. Asterisks after node tip labels indicate sequences from our study that were identical to lineages previously found in non-waterfowl hosts. All reference sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information website." ;
