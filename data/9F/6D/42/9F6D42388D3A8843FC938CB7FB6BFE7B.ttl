    dc:description "Figure 3. – A: Growth curve of the Z. asper group born in captivity (2008) descended from wild Z. asper from the Beaume. At 2 years old, some fish could not be sexed but all Z. asper were mature at 3 years and monitoring of both sexes was possible. At 5 years old, females are significantly longer than males. B: Quantity of food per week for 20 asper (Beaume 2008) in 2015. When the temperature reaches 14 to 15°C in May, Z. asper consume 3 times the quantity of food eaten at 5 to 10°C. From 20°C in July, consumption levels are more than 5 times higher than in the winter." ;

These results were obtained from the number of eggs laid throughout the breeding season divided by the number of females that laid. The same blood- stocks (born in captivity in 2008) were used for 9 years. The maxi- mum production was obtained at 6 years. The number of females was 17 at the beginning and 2 at the end (Tab.

    dc:description "Figure 9. – A: Comparison of incubation results as a function of cold period length from 30 to 120 days. More than 64,000 eggs were collected during these trials and all egg clutches were accurately counted at four key moments of the incubation process: on laying, at 10 days, at transfer for hatching and at hatching. From the first development stages, egg mortality declines as the length of the winter cold period increases. B: Clutch by clutch detail of the incubation survival rate of eggs for batches of “Beaume” broodstock subjected to 3 different temperature periods. The egg clutches produced during the same experiment are identified by an identical colour. Within the same group, survival rate results sometimes varied widely.The hatching rates for broodstock subjected to 90 days of vernalization are the most variable. This wide variability suggests that the 90-day period of cold temperatures creates a boundary, which determines whether reproduction is successful or not. C: Variation in hatching rate (mean and standard deviation) as a function of vernalization period length. Unlike those from the “Beaume” stock, Z. asper of “Durance” stock we used in 2016 and 2017 (captured in 2015 and 2016), were replaced between the two years. The hatching rate varies in accordance with the duration of the cold period experienced by the broodstock during the winter. For the “Beaume” broodstock, Kruskal-Wallis tests show that comparisons between the results obtained with the 120-day period and the other periods are significant (p <0.05). The length of the vernalization period clearly has an influence on the hatching rate. This test was also applied to data from the experiments involving both sets of stock and 120-day periods.As this test was not significant (p = 0.07), it demon- strates that both sets of stock reacted similarly to this vernalization period." ;

    dc:description "Figure 10. – Annual thermal cycle for different life phases of Z. asper. The “gametogenesis” phase starts when temperatures fall in September and continues throughout the winter but slows down in November when the temperature reaches 5°C. This period of time at 5°C, indicated as “vernalization” on the graph, lasts from November to February. The duration of this period is very important because it directly conditions the success of the reproduction. Rapid and regular rising of temperatures to 10°C triggers reproduction from the beginning of March and continues until the end of April." ;
