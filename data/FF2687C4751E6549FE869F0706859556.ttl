    dc:description "Figure 1. Lynceus simiaefacies. A, bisected female, ventral side uppermost, seen from the midline after removal of the labrum which obscures part of trunk limb 1, showing the median face of the 12 left trunk limbs. Limbs 11 and 12 are very small. The trunk limbs lie more or less as at the end of promotion. Of particular note is that, except on the distal scraper-bearing endites, and at the extreme posterior end, the median face of the limbs is covered by a screen of posteriorly and somewhat dorsally directed setae. The gnathobases of the seven anterior limbs are conspicuous: more posterior gnathobases less easily seen. Note how the cuticle-lined food groove, here torn away over much of its length, widens greatly into a ‘basin’ in the vicinity of the first three gnathobases. Trunk limb 12, detached from the right hand series, is present at bottom right. Except that the gnathobase lies proximally its orientation bears no relation to that in life. Scale bar 500 Mm. B, distal elements of gnathobases 4–6, seen within the confines of the food groove (FG). Note the stout denticulated spines that sweep food material forward (here to the left), the smooth curved spines (SCS) that are directed posteriorly, and the long, posteriorly directed, soft retaining setae (RS), of which the anteriormost extends posteriorly across the two gnathobases posterior to it. The tips of many screening setae, of which those seen anteriorly are clogged with screened out detritus, are readily seen. Note how the cuticle that lines the food groove reflects segmentation. The segments, of which parts of four are represented, increase in length from posterior to anterior. Scale bar 100 Mm. All subsequent figures refer to L. simiaefacies." ;

Only part of the armature of endites 2 and 3 is shown to indicate the arrangement of the grid setae and some of the spines. Only the distal armature of endites 4 and 5 and the endopodite is visible from this side. Further rows of scrapers are located more proximally on the hidden margins of these elements, whose location is indicated by a dashed line in each case. Some of these spines are visible distally on the margin of endite 4, but are omitted to avoid confusion in that region. Likewise, only a few of the gnathobasic setae, of which there are two rows anteriorly, are shown. The delicate exopodite is stippled to show its distinctness from the corm. The long setae with which both its dorsal and its ventral lobes are provided are omitted. The long, cylindrical epipodite is also stippled. Scale bar 250 Mm.

    dc:description "Figure 5. A, proximal region of trunk limbs 4 and 5. Endite 2 (E2) is seen overlying the gnathobases (Gn4 and Gn5) and bearing long screening setae and stout spines directed obliquely posteriorly and towards the food groove. Here some of the armature of the grid setae, e.g. at top right, consists of long dorsal setules that rest on the adjacent seta and are held in place by short, spinule-like ventral setules of that seta. Gnathobase 3 (partly visible) has twisted and reveals its densely setose outer face, which overlies the armature of the anterior margin of gnathobase 4 (revealed by its twisting), which it clearly cleans. The soft, flaccid nature of the long posteriorly directed retaining setae (RS) is obvious from the way they have been distorted during preparation of the material. Scale bar 100 Mm. B, proximal parts of trunk limbs 9 and 10, with part of 11 visible. The robust armature of the gnathobases, which sweep along the bottom of the food groove, is well displayed at the bottom of the photograph, as are numerous, mostly short, spines on the posterior margin of each gnathobase, which push and drag food material towards the food groove. These include straight spines and, as seen on gnathobase 10, curved spines that drag rather than push. The long, posteriorly directed retaining seta of gnathobase 9 is the most posterior such of the series. Because of the angle at which the gnathobase is viewed, it appears to be directed ‘vertically’ and is seen from its dorsal side. More distally the dense array of spines of endite 2 is displayed. To the left the posterior limit of the screen is marked by the tips of several screening setae. The armature of the more distal endites of these limbs is illustrated in Figure 8A and B.

    dc:description "Figure 6. A, endopodite of trunk limb 5 (En5) and adjacent scraper-bearing elements. Anterior (to the left) of it are scrapers of the endopodite and endite 5 of trunk limb 4. The endopodite of trunk limb 5 overlies endite 5 of the same limb. The latter bears a row of scrapers distally: more proximally can be seen some of its armature of often pointed spines. More posteriorly, the posterior margin of the endopodite of trunk limb 6 can just be seen. Note the arrangement of scrapers on the endopodite of trunk limb 5. Proximally they are short. More distally they become progressively longer. Most are stout, but the three distalmost, which are the longest, are finely toothed and over-reach and sweep up material dislodged by their shorter, more robust companions. The distalmost spine in the series is smooth. The short, finely toothed proximal scrapers are suitably located to sweep material brought within reach by distal scrapers of the assemblage in front during the previous cycle. Scale bar 100 Mm. B, details of the posterior region of a gnathobase typical of the middle of the series, showing, posteriorly, one of the stout denticulate spines that sweep material forward, i.e. to the left, along the food groove. Near its base is a sensilla. Between the other two conspicuous elements can just be seen the basal portion of the second stout denticulate spine. This lies more laterally, i.e. nearer to the food groove wall, at a deeper level of focus in the darkness of the food groove. Anterior to the posterior denticulate spine is a smooth spine and, anterior to that, a robust sweeping spine with a reflexed distal portion that bears long spinules. The flexure is probably not an artefact (cf. trunk limb 9, Fig. 5B). The distal part of this spine is partly obscured by the long setules of an adjacent sweeping seta (cf. trunk limb 9, Fig. 5B). Scale bar 20 Mm." ;

    dc:description "Figure 8. A, armature of the four posterior trunk limbs as seen in an individual in which they are fortuitously twisted towards the mid line. Proximally the four gnathobases are seen close together, that of limb 11 being jammed between those of limbs 10 and 12. The more distal armature of this limb is largely obscured by that of adjoining limbs. Being the last of the series, with nothing to obscure it posteriorly, trunk limb 12 clearly displays its gnathobase and endites 2–5. Its endopodite is largely obscured by endite 5 but some of its spinous armature can be seen arising from behind that endite. The arrangement of the armature of the endites of this limb facilitates understanding of that of the three more anterior limbs where, especially in limbs 9 and 10, it is seen ‘full face’ and it is difficult to see where that of one endite ends and that of the next begins. That the more proximal armature of all these limbs consists largely of stout spines, sometimes curved near their tips to enable them to drag material towards the food groove, is readily seen. More distally, especially on limbs 9 and 10, the armature of endite 4 includes many stout hook-like spines (for details see Fig. 8B). The posterior limits of the grid setae, which do not cover the apparatus seen here, are seen to the left (anterior) of the illustration. Scale bar 100 Mm. B, details of the distal endites of trunk limbs 9 and 10 seen at greater magnification. The fifth and fourth endites of limbs 9 and 10, seen face on, have a broad posterior ‘margin’, in each case provided with an armature of highly specialized spines of great diversity. On endite 5 the spines extend somewhat obliquely to facilitate the ‘embracing’ of masses of food material. Those of the anterior margin of limb 9 are scrapers that differ somewhat from orthodox scrapers and have hook-like tips. These perhaps serve to sweep and push rather than scrape surfaces, to which access is less easy than for anterior limbs, but their exact role cannot be defined. More distally and posteriorly are hook-like spines of various types and sizes that clearly drag in collected material or, in the case of very large distal hooks, retain it, and there are more hook-like spines internal to the scrapers. On endite 4, a dense and diverse array of hook-like spines and a few small denticulate spines are well suited to passing material proximally. The distal armature of endite 5 of trunk limb 10, while extending outwards so that the entire ensemble forms a scoop, is quite different. Whereas the distalmost spines can clearly scrape and sweep, their close companions bear diverging marginal rows of denticles, well suited to scooping and sweeping masses of material proximally to a region functionally continuous with endite 4, like which it is armed with a profusion of hooks. The large spiniform spines seen on the extreme right are of trunk limb 12. Much of limb 11 is here hidden between this limb and limb 10. These limbs also pass material proximally. Scale bar 50 Mm." ;
