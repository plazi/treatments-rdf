In the case of ALA-treated plants, the 11-day-old seedlings were incubated for additional 3 days in 10 mM ALA solution in the dark before illumination. The data are means ± SE, n = 3–4. FW = fresh weight. The pigments were extracted and analyzed using HPLC as described in the Experimental section." ;
