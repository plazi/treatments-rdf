    dc:description "Figure 1 Results of the cladistic analysis of 1,850 characters among 44 specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex. (A) Strict consensus of 50 MPTs showing the recovery of three primary growth stages separated by the specimen BMRP 2002.4.1. (B) The single ontogram recovered after the exclusion of wildcard specimens, reducing the number of OTUs to 31. Numbers to the left of the internodes are bootstrap and jackknife values, respectively; numbers to the right are Bremer decay indices. Asterisk indicates the type specimen. Ellipses enclose the regions of polytomies produced by the wildcard specimens, which are listed in the lower right hand corner of the corresponding ellipse. Note that the ellipses are limited to one side or the other relative to BMRP 2002.4.1, which corresponds to the topology of the strict consensus ontogram. Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.9192/fig-1" ;

    dc:description "Figure 2 Ontogram of Tyrannosaurus rex showing growth stages, synontomorphies, individual variation, individual specimens, and chronological ages. Arrowhead points to the most mature spe- cimen and the direction of the entire ontogenetic axis; that is, the least mature specimen is at the lower left whereas the most mature specimen is at the upper right. Asterisk indicates the type specimen. Individual variation occurs as progressions until young adulthood, where reversals are first seen. The maximum amount of change occurs at growth stages 5 and 6, which corresponds to the transition from a long and low skull and jaws to a deep and stout skull frame; this event, marked by the concentration of an extreme number of changes, is evidence that the ontogeny of T. rex is metamorphic (sensu Rose & Reiss, 1993). Each circle represents a numbered growth stage; these numbers do not correspond to those seen in Fig. 12. The star at growth stage 7 marks the ~3,000 kg threshold that separates T. rex from its closest, but smaller, relatives. Color key: red, small juveniles; orange, large juveniles; yellow, subadults; green, young adults; blue, adults; violet, senescent adults. See text for definition of growth categories. Skulls are to scale; AMNH FARB 5027 is scaled to a premaxilla to quadrate length of 1.3 m. Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.9192/fig-2" ;

Most of the growth changes are ancestral for Archosauriformes. The position of several characters at progressively exclusive clades is almost certainly an artifact of missing data (e.g., increase in mandible height, enlargement of muscle attachments, etc.) and they are predicted to be synapomorphic for Archosauriformes once the appropriate data are acquired. This comparison shows that highly derived species such as Tyrannosaurus rex do not deviate from the ancestral growth trends that first evolved in significantly smaller taxa. See text for sources; see Table 23 for the distribution of character states among the taxa. Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.9192/fig-33" ;
