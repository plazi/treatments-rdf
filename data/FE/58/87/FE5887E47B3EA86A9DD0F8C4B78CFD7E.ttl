    dc:description "Box 3. Making dinosaur growth curves Longevity estimates are coupled with size data (from direct measures of length or mass estimates from bone circumferences) for dinosaurs to make age-versus-size growth curves.In Figure Iaι femur length was used for the sauropod Janeschia to produce a simple growth curve. This plot was used for determining the age of sexual maturity (hypothesized as occurring when the growth rates initially slowed) and somatic maturity (full adult size as indicated by the asymptote [23]). The curve can also be used to assess linear growth rates at various points in development. (Redrawn and reproduced with permission from [23].) Age-versus-mass growth curvesι such as the one shown in Figure Ib for North American tyrannosaurs [12], are generally sigmoidal in shapeι except in cases where older adult animals are not represented and the asymptote is absent. Timing to somatic maturityι mass standardized maximal growth rates and other life-history parameters can be assessed and used in both interspecific comparative and evolutionary contexts from this type of curve.

    dc:description "Box 4. Comparison of maximal growth rates in dinosaurs to those in extant vertebrates In Figure I, Maximal growth rates for dinosaurs were deduced from age-mass growth curves for six dinosaurs represented by lettered boxes (from smallest to largest: Shuvuuia (Sh), Psittacosaurus (P), SYntarsus (Sy), MassospondYlus (Ms), Maiasaura (Ma) and Apato- saurus (A); [10]). These data were then plotted with similar data for major living vertebrate clades [5]. A regression line was fitted to the dinosaur data spanning the bounds of known dinosaur size. The results show that whole-organism growth rates for dinosaurs were faster than those of living reptiles of equivalent size. This finding supports qualitative conclusions to the same effect based on tissue- level signal and the reasoning underlying Amprino’s rule [11,26]. However the data do not conform to theories that dinosaurs grew in the same manner as living birds, mammals [6], or at rates between reptiles and birds and/or mammals [8]. Rather, dinosaur growth rates show a unique scaling trajectory. The regression [Maximal growth rate 0.002215 (M)0.925; R2 0.961] also reveals that small = adult = size in dinosaurs involved decreases in absolute growth rates [10]. One caveat of this being the first plot of its kind is that only a small sampling of species was available at the time. The addition of further data, particularly for large sauropods, where Sander [23] has found what appear to be considerably lower growth rates than those reported by Curry [25], might force reanalysis of the aforementioned trends.

    dc:description "Box 1. Assessing dinosaur longevity from growth-line counts Making growth curves for dinosaurs requires estimations of longevity for various individuals throughout development. To do this, osteo- histologists sample bones from specimens spanning juvenile through adult developmental stages. The bones that are utilized show minimal remodeling (i.e. replacement or loss of the original bone during life because of metabolic, reproductiveι biomechanical, or skeletal repair considerations [9]) and therefore provide a nearly complete record of development.Traditionally, dinosaur researchers have used the femur, but other bones have been shown to be equally or more efficacious in some taxa. For example, multi-element sampling in tyrannosaurs has shown (Figure Ia) that the bones shown in blue [pubis, fibula, ribs, gastralia (i.e. belly ribs) and some post-orbital skull bones] work better than the femur in these animals [12,24]. The bones are sectioned transversely at mid-shaft using a slow-speed saw fitted with a diamond-tipped blade (Figure Ib). The sections (Figure Ic) are then affixed to glass petrographic slides and sanded/polished for viewing with polarized and/or reflected microscopy. On very large specimens for which making entire cross- sectional slidesisdifficult,researchers polish the cut facesof the bones to reveal ‘polished lines’ that reflect hardness differences between indivi- dual growth lines [20,23,31]. Alternatively, Sanders has developed a method whereby a diamond-tipped drill coring-bit is used to extract a cylinder of bone from which polished-line preparations or petrographic slides can be made [23]. Aging is conducted by making total growth line counts within elements [28]. Here (Figure Ic), a thin-sectioned, dorsal rib from TYrannosaurus rex (Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, FMNH PR 2081) shows growth lines (arrows) that were counted to age this specimen. Each line represents a period of slowed and/or potential stoppage in tissue deposition [9]. The highly vascularized regions between the rings are known as zones and represent periods of active growth [8,9]. The inset box denotes a region late in development composed of tightly stacked growth rings known as an external fundamental system that indicates when growth slowed precipitously 22,27]. At this point in development, somatic maturity and full-adult size was reached. (Figure I redrawn and reproduced with permission from [12]. Scale bar=10 mm.)" ;
