A, main part (part A or ‘less part’ when referring to anatomic orientation of the split skeleton) in which most cranial structures and upper teeth were preserved; B, counterpart (part B or ‘right part’) in which most lower teeth were preserved. Red boxes 1–7 correspond to figure panels A–G in Figures 6 and 8–10 and to A–D in Figure 5. Note that the skeleton is preserved in association with numerous valves of conchostracans that are typical invertebrate fossils in the Daohugou strata. The dark area probably represents residues of the pelage, possibly the patagium (see Figs 5 and 6 for comparison with extant gliding mammals). Abbreviations:l-fe, less femur; l-fi, less fibula; l-hu, less humerus; l-I2, less and presumably the second upper incisor; l-ra, less radius; l-ti, less tibia; l-ul, less ulna; r-I2, right and presumably the second upper incisor." ;

Abbreviations:amf, anterior extremity of the masseteric fossa; cop, coronoid process; glf, glenoid fossa; l-i, less lower incisor; l-I2, less upper incisor (I2); l-M1, less upper first molar; l-m1, less lower first molar; l-m2, less second lower molar; l-M2, less second upper molar; l-P2, less second upper premolar; l-P3, less third upper premolar; l-p4, less ultimate premolar (p4); mac, mandibular condyle; mef, mental foramen; nuc, nuchal crest; r-I2, right upper incisor (I2); r-P2, right upper second premolar; r-P3, right upper third premolar; r-P4, right upper ultimate premolar (P4); zya, zygomatic arch." ;

A, hair impressions at the outer area of the body fur; these hairs are long, fine, and somewhat curly.B, imaged area in the middle of the body fur impression; hair impressions are still visible but not so distinct compared to (A). C, imaged area near the skeleton, where the hair impression is unclear; this area may represent organic remains less by skin.D, imaged area on top of the skull, showing short, fine, and dense hair.E, imaged area around the forearm, showing long hair in comparison with the limb bones. F, sampled area along part of the caudal vertebrae; F’, close-up view of the red-boxed area in (F). The hairs along the caudal vertebrae are long, thick, and straight. Numerous unidentified spherical particles are caught among the coarse hair, as pointed by the two white arrows and exemplified in the upper right corner.G, imaged area near the chest, showing carbonated films of the rib and dark areas that are possible organic remains less by skin.Note that in all these areas, there seems no evidence, such as a clear membrane edge, that suggests a patagium.However, it seems unlikely that all the dark areas represent fur. For instance, the dark area along the caudal vertebrae is much broader than the area bearing the coarse hair; such a wide area does not seem to be formed only by hair but possibly suggests presence of the patagium; H, from top to boưom: marsupial Petraurus (AMNH 196914), gliding; Marmosa (AMNH 266428), arboreal; and Monodelphis (AMNH 263547), terrestrial; I, placental Glaucomys (AMNH 188250), gliding; these show extension of the pelage in the body and tail morphology of gliding species in contrast to nongliding species." ;

Note the root condition in each tooth. In (C) the root of the right incisor is broken, whereas the tooth crown of the less one is blocked by the right one. The teeth are restored digitally from the main and counterpart slabs and represent the preserved condition in the matrix.The white line outlines of the occlusal surfaces of the upper cheek teeth in lingual and buccal views, showing the en echelon (steplike) paưern, as first noted in Haramiyavia (Jenkins et al. 1997).

A, less hindlimb, showing the hair impressions in related to the limb bones. The hair distribution is narrowest at the ankle area and becomes much broad toward the knee; such an area does not seem to be all aưributable to only hair because the hair impressions appear fine and short; it is most likely that the hair is on the patagium that stretched from the hindlimb to the tail and to the trunk of the body; B, the less pes in dorsal view, showing the toes, claws, potential impressions of the pedal skin or digital pads that outline the shapes of the toes that are long and well separated.Hair are short and fine on the instep and toes; C, disarticulated right pes, showing the shapes and relative lengths of the footbones; D, a claw in the manus, showing the remain and impression of keratinous claw and relationship of the phalanx (partial impression) and claw sheath; E, bony elements of the pes of euharamiyidan (unpublished figure) in ventral view, showing the relative length of the bony elements; F, the bony elements of the manus of Shenshou; G–I, pes morphologies of extant marsupials in dorsal view (G, gliding Petaurus, AMNH 196914; H, arboreal Marmosa, AMNH 266428; I, terrestrial Monodelphis, AMNH 263547); J–L, pes morphologies of extant placentals in dorsal view (J, gliding Glaucomys, AMNH 188250; K, arboreal Microsciurus, AMNH 32497; L, terrestrial Geosciurus, AMNH 83652); M, bony elements of the pes of Glaucomy in dorsal view (AMNH 267293).
